##### Repository Description

This repository contains the data and Jupyter notebooks for my final project, "Using Regression Methods to Model Institutional Impact on Undergraduate Computer Science Gender Parity," which was completed for SML 312: Research Projects in Data Science at Princeton University during the Fall 2022 semester.

#### Research Question and Abstract

The project addresses the following research question: "What institutional-level characteristics, if any, are the best predictors of the gender parity of undergraduate computer science programs based in the United States?"

The project abstract can be found below:

The gender gap in undergraduate computer science programs remains significant, limiting women's participation in computer science. In the United States, women make about 20% of all computer science undergraduates, but this statistic varies across institutions. Little is known about the institutional differences that could contribute these varying levels of institutional gender parity. Using data from the National Center for Education Statistics on the characteristics of U.S. based, 4-year higher education institutions with undergraduate computer science programs, this project implements regression models to determine the most important institutional-level predictors of gender parity in computer science.
